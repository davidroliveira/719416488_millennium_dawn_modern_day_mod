 body_armor_1980: "Kevlar Vest"
 body_armor_1980_desc: "The first modern body armours before the famous Kevlar vests were mainly made of nylon. Kevlar was first introduced in 1975, and the first vests were adopted to the US Army in the 1980s.\n\nThe first vests offered protection only to the upper torso, and they only protected from shrapnel and pistol rounds."
 body_armor_2000: "Plate Reinforced Vest"
 body_armor_2000_desc: "Even though ceramics have been used in personal protection for long, the first modern ballistic plates were introduced in late 90s and early 2000s. The ballistic plates in these new vests would provide protection from rifle rounds, and shrapnel protection of the vest itself would extend to groinal and neck areas and not just the upper torso."
 body_armor_2010: "Improved Tactical Vest"
 body_armor_2010_desc: "While offering great protection, plate reinforced vests can be cumbersome to the user. This lead to several body armour manufacturers to look for more lighter and tactical designs. While also providing protection, body armour shouldn't limit a soldiers ability to operate on the field. Modern body armours offer integrated solutions where the tactical vests allow personal customisation by the user, making the same vest usable in almost every situation. The protective capabilities are also improved, as modern body armour is capable of even stopping armour piercing bullets."

 modern_blitzkrieg: "Modern Blitzkrieg"
 modern_blitzkrieg_desc: "Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, Germany's blitzkrieg doctrine was widely copied by others, becoming a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought - especially in NATO circles. It aims to concentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously maneuver into enemy territory whilst avoiding enemy strong points."
 forward_defense: "Forward Defense"
 forward_defense_desc: "Forward defense was an attempt to counter the threat of Soviet armor overrunning Western Europe. Pre-planned defensive forces would starve off the initial push while reserves would be mobilized behind them. The idea was that the initial battles would determine the outcome of the war, and thus the majority of active forces should be placed close to the front."
 encourage_nco_iniative: "Encourage NCO Initiative"
 encourage_nco_iniative_desc: "Western military thought encouraged initiative among non-commissioned officers (lower-level command), viewing them as the backbone of their armies. With rapidly changing situations, avoiding having to go through the entire chain of command allows an NCO to exploit opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed."
 air_land_battle: "AirLand Battle"
 air_land_battle_desc: "AirLand battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense and air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding the enemy front line. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat front line forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear."
 grand_battleplan: "Grand Battleplan"
 grand_battleplan_desc: "The grand battleplan doctrine favors extensive pre-planning of each stage of combat. When done correctly, troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. While good planning avoids logistical problems, it reduces initiative and has no real flexibility."
 rigid_hierarchy: "Rigid Hierarchy"
 rigid_hierarchy_desc: "With the legitimate fear that one’s own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be manned out of political loyalty instead of competence. Large, live-fire exercises would generally not be held. Furthermore, decision-making would be centralized, making it slow and inflexible in the face of evolving threats."
 praetorian_guard: "Praetorian Guard"
 praetorian_guard_desc: "With the political leadership focusing the army on regime protection, elite units were set up that employed professional soldiers with ideological selection and training. These would receive the best weapons and training, making them well-placed to defend the political leadership from uprisings and the threat of coups by the normal conscripted army."
 armoured_mass_assault: "Mass Armoured Assault"
 armoured_mass_assault_desc: "Mass armoured assault stressed combined arms cooperation, offensive action, and heavily armored shock units. Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units. At the same time, highly mobile armored and mechanized forces would be held in reserve, advancing into the front once gaps were created."
 deep_echelon_advance: "Deep Echelon Advance"
 deep_echelon_advance_desc: "With gaps in enemy lines successfully created, several advances of heavily armored shock troops would ravage the enemy rear at a high speed while avoiding strong points of enemy resistance. The goal is to seize enemy territory at breakneck speed, creating the conditions whereby the enemy loses the will to mount an operational defence."
 army_group_operational_freedom: "Army Group Operational Freedom"
 army_group_operational_freedom_desc: "While rigid in tactical disposition, the Soviet doctrine allowed significant operational freedom to army group formations, enabling ground commanders to make quick decisions. This freedom was larger than among NATO forces at the time, but it did not extend down to lower officers and commanders."
 massed_artillery: "Massed Artillery"
 massed_artillery_desc: "Using large amounts of both regular artillery and rocket artillery concentrated at the frontline enemy, the hope was to break and disrupt their normal functions. Using artillery in such numbers also reduces the need for air support. The sheer numbers led many to call both the Russian and Soviet armies an "artillery army with tanks"."
 infiltration_assault: "Infiltration Assault"
 infiltration_assault_desc: "The infiltration assault doctrine uses night-time infiltration behind enemy strong points to allow surprise assaults at normally well-defended positions to succeed by cutting them off from reinforcements."
 defence_in_depth: "Defense in Depth"
 defence_in_depth_desc: "Defense in depth, often also called "elastic defense", is all about delaying the advance of the enemy. Supply depots and pre-made fortifications should be placed far from the front, as should the majority of forces. By buying time and causing additional enemy casualties by yielding space, the enemy momentum will wear down from attrition."
 armoured_counterpunch: "Armoured Counterpunch"
 armoured_counterpunch_desc: "Building upon defense in depth, this strategy is about deploying significant armored forces at advantageous times in order to cut off deep echelon advances, achieving a decisive victory. However, such concentrations are vulnerable to enemy airpower."
 frontline_defence: "Frontline Defense"
 frontline_defence_desc: "Massing the majority of pre-planned defensive forces as close to the border as possible yields us the largest chance of maintaining territory, which is essential if we have a limited area to retreat to."

 Network_Centric_Warfare: "Network-Centric Warfare"
 Network_Centric_Warfare_desc: "Network-centric warfare was pioneered by the US in the '90s, based on introducing command and control and intelligent sensors at increasingly lower levels of the armed forces. This will enable enhanced situational awareness for decision-makers and combat forces alike, as well as rapid target assessment using supercomputers."
 TITLE_DECENTRALIZED: "Decentralized Warfare"
 DECENTRALIZED_WARFARE_TITLE: "By decentralizing command structures and expanding informational warfare into all aspects of society, one can deny the enemy situational awareness and gain local operational advantages."
 Decentralized_Warfare: "Decentralized Warfare"
 Decentralized_Warfare_desc: "Decentralized and asymmetric warfare has been pioneered by Iran and Russia. It assumes that a conflict against a networked and technologically superior opponent can cripple the command and control structure. The solution has been to transform into smaller military units with independent decision-making and command structures to remain effective."
 TITLE_GUERILLA: "Guerrilla Warfare"
 GUERILLA_WARFARE_TITLE: "By denying a superior enemy decisive battle and instead attacking their support structure, they will be forced to disperse into smaller units we can catch by surprise. Blurring the lines between combatant and civilian, we spread chaos and demoralize the enemy into admitting defeat."
 Guerilla_Warfare: "Guerrilla Warfare"
 Guerilla_Warfare_desc: "Widely in usage by non-state actors, guerrilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be achieved through terrain or ambushes. Non-military means such as psychological warfare are employed to wear down the opponent’s stability and will to fight."
 Civilian_Infiltration: "Civilian Infiltration"
